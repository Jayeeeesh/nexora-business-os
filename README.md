## Architecture

Nexora follows a separated frontend-backend architecture with clear responsibility boundaries.

React + Vite Frontend

Node.js + Express Backend
        ↓
Mongoose
        ↓
MongoDB
```

## Testing & CI/CD

### Automated Testing

The project includes automated coverage for critical frontend and backend flows.

- Backend API tests cover authentication, project CRUD, ownership isolation, validation, and health checks
- Frontend tests cover authentication flows, protected routing, dashboard metric calculations, and project validation rules
- Supertest is used for backend HTTP integration testing
- Vitest and React Testing Library are used for frontend testing

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions runs automated checks on pull requests and pushes.

The CI pipeline verifies:

- Frontend linting
- Frontend tests
- Frontend production build
- Backend syntax validation
- Backend API tests

Changes are merged into `main` only after the required CI checks pass.

## Security & Production Readiness

Nexora includes several safeguards for authentication, data isolation, and production configuration.

- JWT authentication stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Production cookies configured with secure browser settings
- Protected backend routes for authenticated users
- User-scoped project queries to prevent cross-account project access
- Project ownership cannot be reassigned through update requests
- CORS configured for the deployed frontend origin
- Sensitive configuration managed through environment variables
- Production startup validation for required environment variables
- Dependency security auditing with patched known vulnerabilities
- API health endpoint for deployment monitoring
- Separate application and server startup structure for improved testability and deployment

## Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- A MongoDB connection string

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jayeeeesh/nexora-business-os.git
cd nexora-business-os
```

### 2. Configure and run the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your local configuration:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_long_random_secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development
```

Start the backend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will run at:

```text
http://localhost:5001
```

### 3. Configure and run the frontend

Open a second terminal from the repository root:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Configure the frontend API URL:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will display the local application URL, typically:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Run automated tests

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:run
```

### 5. Run frontend quality checks

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```
